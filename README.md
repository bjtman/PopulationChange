# Population Change

This project uses the p5 processing javascript library to access US Census data using the City SDK available here:

https://uscensusbureau.github.io/citysdk/

The concept we explore is looking at population change per state in both a graphical and aural context. For example, if the male population grew more than the female population in a given state between 1990 and 2010 then a musical tone actuates. This tone quickly conveys the information while simultaneously the data is visualized using hexagons whose size are proportional to their population value.

A live version of the software is here: https://course.fathom.info/c/tice_brian/final/PopulationChange/
